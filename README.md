## Quantifying Student Performances

Understanding the factors that determine student performance throughout various stages of education is a worthy yet challenging task. A comprehensive model of student performance would enable educators to help struggling students perform better and continue pursuing education, which has broad societal benefits. 

The primary nature of this project is prediction  as we try to predict whether or not a student fails a class using a subset of variables from the dataset. The dataset selected contains 650 grades achieved in across two Portugese high schools in a Portugese class accompanied by a diverse set of factors that attempt to contextualize a given student's performance. It was collected by Cortez, P., &amp; Silva, A. (2008) by using school reports and questionnaires completed by students. Variables we may consider for this prediction question include degree of internet access, study time, or degree of socialization. An important precursor to this study is the feature selection process which is necessary given an abundance of predictor variables. 

Prior to leveraging feature selection methods, we instead use a literary research-based approach to find variables relevant to a student's performance and decrease the dimensionality of our data. Through reading studies Klein et al., (2022), Moos & Moos (1978), and Pellerin (2005) we compile a list of variables that quantify the factors mentioned in the literature. We offer an overview of these relevant predictor variables and the target below.
